            George Alexander was a man of vision and generosity. His life story
            is a tale of achievement in the face of great odds, and it
            exemplifies the ethos that has helped build modern Australia.

          Founder – George H. Alexander AM (1910–2008)
        </p>
        <p class="founder__desc">
          A teenage English immigrant, a farmworker, a mechanic, a lecturer and
          a businessman, George was, in many ways, a lifelong student and
          teacher. In the words of his biographer Dr Peter Yule, George
          Alexander was 'a self-made man whose life experiences inspired a wish
          to help others.' His story provides inspiration for anyone who
          believes that determination and perseverance can overcome adversity.

          <p class="years__desc">
            Born in London in 1910, George was raised by his grandparents in
            Hampshire. He was a bright student with an ambition to become a
            motor mechanic, but his family could not afford the cost of an
            apprenticeship. He left school at age 13 to work in a bicycle shop.
          </p>
          <p class="years__desc">
            In 1926 at the age of fifteen, George Alexander migrated alone to
            Australia under the Big Brother Movement, an organisation that
            brought young British men to Australia to work on the land. He spent
            18 months working on a dairy farm at Willatook in Western Victoria
            and then went to try wheat farming near Marnoo, 50 km from St
            Arnaud. After the harvest, he was sent by the Big Brother Movement
            to work at Liparoo in the semi-desert Mallee country. Sadly the
            crops he helped plant failed - it only rained once in the time
            George was there.
          </p>
          <p class="years__desc">
            Times were tough during the Depression years and in 1930 he was out
            of work for several months in Melbourne. He returned to Willatook
            for a short time and then moved to nearby Koroit, near Geelong where
            he worked in a local garage and finally realised his dream of
            becoming an A grade mechanic.
